# Applying-Deep-learning-on-MNIST-Dataset
MNIST is a popular digit image(28X28 pixels) dataset in which each image is a hand-drawn picture of numeric digits from 0-9

In this repo there are two main categories of models one is based on MLP which takes each pixel as input, Second one is CNN which takes care of locality using convilution of kernels.
We can witness the difference in results of both types
# Structure of Repo-
* There are two ipynb notebooks one with MLP another with CNN
* PDF form is also available
* First go To MLP then CNN
